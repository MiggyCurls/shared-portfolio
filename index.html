            Computer Science student, Miguel Gomez, and Electrical Engineering student, 
            Ian Rios, have come together to showcase how our love for programming<br> can
            make this website and routinely add to it. This shows good initiative for
            both of us and acts as good practice to improve our knowledge of web<br>
            development; the cooperative nature of this website allows for our 
            creativity in our fields to come to fruition and work to accomplish what 
            we set our minds on.<br> Version control of this code will be down with Git
            and the Git provider to host our code (Remote repository) will be hosted 
            on Github.
